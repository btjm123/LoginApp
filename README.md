# LoginApp (No coding required)

That's right folks. No coding is required.

Of course,this app does not implement real 'signing-up/login' system.
It is actually designed to teach you the basics of organizing a layout in Xcode 8 as well as how to segue from a view to another view without any code at all.

This repo serves as a companion to a video tutorial (Design a Sign Up Screen | Swift 3 and Xcode 8) from my youtube channel(BR Studio).
